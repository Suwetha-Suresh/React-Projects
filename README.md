# React-Projects
All my react based projects that I developed whilst practicing the same.
Install all the requiered node modules to run the projects.


I worked on these projects from 9-4-2023 to 29-4-2023 till the todo lists and planning to add more on this, i.e., react.js based projects.


Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
